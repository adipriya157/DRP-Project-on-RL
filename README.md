# Project README
## Overview
This project contains all of the work, analysis, and exploratory modeling performed on two different datasets: one involving a single fish dataset and another involving a three-fish dataset. The purpose of the project is to walk through a complete data science workflow in a way that is understandable to another human, even if they were not involved in the original work. Each notebook is written as a step-by-step narrative that starts with getting familiar with the data and ends with building, evaluating, and interpreting predictive models. The idea is to make the project readable, replicable, and easy to reference later.
## Project Files
### DRP_Final_Project_3Fish_V2.ipynb
This notebook focuses on the dataset containing three fish. It includes an explanation of the raw data, cleaning steps, decisions made during preprocessing, visual exploration of trends or patterns, and the full modeling pipeline. The notebook highlights why certain features were created or removed, what model types were attempted, how performance was measured, and what the results ultimately mean. It is meant to be a polished, narrative walkthrough rather than a messy scratchpad.
### DROP_Final_Project_1Fish.ipynb
This notebook performs a similar analysis but for a single-fish dataset. Because the dataset is simpler, the emphasis is slightly different: more attention is given to understanding how the more limited feature space affects the modeling process. The notebook includes data preparation, visualizations, model experiments, and a discussion comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the one-fish dataset relative to the three-fish version.
## Requirements
To run the notebooks successfully, you will need Python 3.8 or higher along with standard data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. If a requirements.txt file exists, installing everything is as simple as running:
